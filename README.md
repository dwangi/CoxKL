# DiscreteKL: Kullback-Leibler-Based Cox Models

This package is for the paper "Incorporating External Risk Information with the Cox Model under Population Heterogeneity: Applications to Trans-Ancestry Polygenic Hazard Scores".

## Purpose

Incorporating external information can improve the performance of risk discrimination in an internal small-sized cohort. However, given that external risk scores and internal individual-level data come from different populations, ignoring population heterogeneity can introduce substantial bias. Thus, we develop a Kullback-Leibler-based Cox model (CoxKL) to integrate internal individual-level time-to-event data with external risk scores derived from published prediction models.
