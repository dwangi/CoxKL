# CoxKL: Kullback-Leibler-Based Cox Models

This package is for the paper "Incorporating External Risk Information with the Cox Model under Population Heterogeneity: Applications to Trans-Ancestry Polygenic Hazard Scores".

## Purpose

Incorporating external information can improve the performance of risk discrimination in an internal small-sized cohort. However, given that external risk scores and internal individual-level data come from different populations, ignoring population heterogeneity can introduce substantial bias. Thus, we develop a Kullback-Leibler-based Cox model (CoxKL) to integrate internal individual-level time-to-event data with external risk scores derived from published prediction models.

## Installation

```
#Install the package, need to install the devtools packages:
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("UM-KevinHe/CoxKL")
```

## Using CoxKL

```
#Use CoxKL estimate
KL_Cox_Estimate(z, delta, time, RS_internal, eta, tol=1.0e-7)
```
- z: covariate matrix.
- delta: vector of event indicators (1 = event, 0 = censor).
- time: vector of observed times.
- RS_internal: vector of predicted risk scores for subjects in the internal data.
- eta: integration weight. Note that if eta = 0, the CoxKL model reduces to a classical Cox model using internal data only.

```
#Use cross-validation to select the optimal integration weight
kl_cox(RiskScore, eta_min, eta_max, length.out, eta_minby, df_internal, criteria, fold)
```
- RiskScore: vector of predicted risk scores for subjects in the internal data.
- eta_min, eta_max, length.out, eta_minby: for the integration weight sequence consturction, where eta_min is the start value, eta_max is the end value, length.out is the length of eta sequence for each round of parameter search, and eta_minby is the minimal increment of the eta sequence. 
- df_internal: internal data (Z, status, time).
- criteria: model performance criteria for cross-validation, can be chose from "V&VH", "C-Index", "LP: log-partial likelihood", "LP: C-Index", as discussed in
  Dai, B. and Breheny, P. (2019). Cross validation approaches for penalized Cox regression. arXiv:1905.10432.
- fold: desired number of folds for cross-validation.
