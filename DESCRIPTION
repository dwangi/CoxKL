Description: Incorporating external information can improve the performance of risk discrimination in an internal small-sized cohort. However, given that external risk scores and internal individual-level data come from different populations, ignoring population heterogeneity can introduce substantial bias. Thus, we develop a Kullback-Leibler-based Cox model (CoxKL) to integrate internal individual-level time-to-event data with external risk scores derived from published prediction models.
